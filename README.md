# Patient Survival Predictor

This project aims to predict patient survival outcomes using a machine learning model trained on the oral cancer prediction dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `oral_cancer_prediction_dataset.csv`. It contains information about patients diagnosed with oral cancer, including various features such as age, gender, tumor stage, treatment type, and survival status.

## Code

The code for this project is located in the `notebooks/` directory. The `example.py` script performs the following tasks:

1.  Loads the dataset.
2.  Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
3.  Preprocesses the data for model training.
4.  Trains a machine learning model to predict patient survival.
5.  Evaluates the model's performance.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

*   pandas
*   scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Patient_Survival_Predictor

**## Usage**
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/patient-survival-predictor.git
